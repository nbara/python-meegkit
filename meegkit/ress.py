    """Rhythmic entrainment source separation [1]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X: array, shape=(n_samples, n_chans, n_trials)
        Data to denoise.
    sfreq : int
        Sampling frequency.
    peak_freq : float
        Peak frequency.
    neig_freq : float
        Distance of neighbouring frequencies away from peak frequency, +/- in
        Hz (default=1).
    peak_width : float
        FWHM of the peak frequency (default=.5).
    neig_width : float
        FWHM of the neighboring frequencies (default=1).
    n_keep : int
        Number of components to keep (default=1). -1 keeps all components.
    return_maps : bool
        If True, also output mixing (to_ress) and unmixing matrices
        (from_ress), used to transform the data into RESS component space and
        back into sensor space, respectively.

    Returns
    -------
    out : array, shape=(n_samples, n_keep, n_trials)
        RESS time series.
    from_ress : array, shape=(n_components, n_channels)
        Unmixing matrix (projects to sensor space).
    to_ress : array, shape=(n_channels, n_components)
        Mixing matrix (projects to component space).

    Examples
    --------
    To project the RESS components back into sensor space, one can proceed as
    follows:
    >>> # First apply RESS
    >>> from meegkit.utils import matmul3d  # handles 3D matrix multiplication
    >>> out, fromRESS, _ = ress.RESS(data, sfreq, peak_freq, return_maps=True)
    >>> # Then matrix multiply each trial by the unmixing matrix:
    >>> proj = matmul3d(out, fromRESS)

    To transform a new observation into RESS component space (e.g. in the
    context of a cross-validation, with separate train/test sets):
    >>> # Start by applying RESS to the train set:
    >>> out, _, toRESS = ress.RESS(data, sfreq, peak_freq, return_maps=True)
    >>> # Then multiply your test data by the toRESS:
    >>> new_comp = new_data @ toRESS
